# intprog_group_repo

This repository contains the group's code for the course **Integrative Programming and Technologies**.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to learn how to utilize GitHubâ€™s **branching feature**. Branching allows for easier and more efficient coding by enabling developers to work on separate branches without affecting the main codebase.

The **repository leader** is responsible for managing all activities within the repository, ensuring that only authorized developers can commit to necessary branches, especially the `main` or `master` branch.
